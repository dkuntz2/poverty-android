# Poverty for Android

This is a simple Android client for [Poverty](https://github.com/neofu50/poverty).
For this to run, you need to be running a copy of Poverty somewhere, and change
the `BASE_URL` field of `co.kuntz.poverty.http.PovertyHttpClient` to wherever you're
running it.

Please note, Poverty has no security on it, and as such, if you run it on the
wild wild world wide web be aware that someone might be able to mess with your
data.

__NOTE__: At present, Poverty needs to be running on the `android-server`
branch.
